							PIND BALLUCHI is the ideal place to satiate all your North Indian food cravings and transport you into the quintessential Pind of Punjab. The experience starts from the entrance itself where effigy of traditionally attired Sardar Ji is sitting on a Manji (traditional cot) and Durban (a janitor) in a typical Punjabi dress welcomes you with a ‘Sat Sri Akal’. The traditional entrance doors, jharokhas, wooden chairs and lanterns add on to the entire village set up along with the waiters of the restaurant who are attired in a traditional uniform.

Artificial Banyan Tree under the romantic and cozy moonlit sky effects, mud plastered walls, jharokhas with dazzling hanging beads and bangles play a vital role in enhancing aesthetics of the restaurant. All the outlets are a fine example of balance where traditional and the modern design elements co-exist in natural harmony with five elements of nature: air, water, earth, fire and, ether. The open kitchen which is a focal point of the restaurant, gives PIND BALLUCHI its heart and soul, and exudes a feeling of dining in a virtual food factory.
